  abstract = {Vision is thought to scaffold the development of spatial abilities in the other senses. How does spatial hearing therefore develop in people lacking visual experience? We comprehensively addressed this question by investigating auditory localization abilities in 17 congenitally blind and 17 sighted individuals using a psychophysical minimum audible angle task exempt of sensori-motor confounds. Participants were asked to compare the relative position of two sound sources located in central and peripheral, horizontal and vertical, frontal and rear spaces. We observed unequivocal enhancement of spatial hearing abilities in congenitally blind people, irrespective of the field of space that is assessed. Our results are conclusive in demonstrating that visual experience is not a mandatory prerequisite for developing optimal spatial hearing abilities and that, in striking contrast, the lack of vision leads to ubiquitous enhancement of auditory spatial skills.},

  abstract = {Despite rapid growth in the number of treatments to rehabilitate dysphagia, studies often demonstrate mixed results with non-significant changes to functional outcomes. Given that power analyses are infrequently reported in dysphagia research, it remains unclear whether studies are adequately powered to detect a range of treatment effects. Therefore, this review sought to examine the current landscape of statistical power in swallowing rehabilitation research. Databases were searched for swallowing treatments using instrumental evaluations of swallowing and the penetration–aspiration scale as an outcome. Sensitivity power analyses based on each study’s statistical test and sample size were performed to determine the minimum effect size detectable with 80\% power. Eighty-nine studies with 94 treatment comparisons were included. Sixty-seven percent of treatment comparisons were unable to detect effects smaller than d\,=\,0.80. The smallest detectable effect size was d\,=\,0.29 for electrical stimulation, d\,=\,0.49 for postural maneuvers, d\,=\,0.52 for non-invasive brain stimulation, d\,=\,0.61 for combined treatments, d\,=\,0.63 for respiratory-based interventions, d\,=\,0.70 for lingual strengthening, and d\,=\,0.79 for oral sensory stimulation. Dysphagia treatments examining changes in penetration–aspiration scale scores were generally powered to reliably detect larger effect sizes and not smaller (but potentially clinically meaningful) effects. These findings suggest that non-significant results may be related to low statistical power, highlighting the need for collaborative, well-powered intervention studies that can detect smaller, clinically meaningful changes in swallowing function. To facilitate implementation, a tutorial on simulation-based power analyses for ordinal outcomes is provided (https://osf.io/e6usd/).},

  abstract = {This paper explores the acquisition of personal reference terms in Thai, a language with a highly complex personal reference system. Two separate studies were conducted for this paper, each featuring two groups of participants: children with typical development (TD) and children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). In each study, the participants were asked to complete two tasks on personal reference terms: a production task and a comprehension task. Overall, children with ASD performed on par in production, in terms of overall communicative success. However, an important finding was that they demonstrated a tendency toward pronoun avoidance, being less likely than children with TD to use deictic first-person pronominal forms. Instead, they preferred to use fixed referential terms for self-reference, contrasting with the children with TD’s preference for personal pronouns. The performance of children with ASD was significantly poorer in comprehension than that of children with TD. Children with ASD were generally able to detect lexically encoded person features but struggled with the more pragmatic and socially deictic aspects of personal reference terms. The latter also posed some challenges for children with TD, albeit to a lesser extent. In this regard, our results align with previous claims in the literature that lexical presuppositions are acquired earlier than implicated presuppositions. Our findings also add various new insights in terms of both population-specific effects in a language previously unstudied in this regard and the specific ways in which aspects of implicated presuppositions, i.e., the type of content in play, give rise to particular challenges in acquisition in general and for children with ASD in particular.}

In this tutorial, we first argue that data reporting in primary studies can meaningfully affect the results of meta-analyses and, most importantly, the subsequent interpretations and use of the findings in research, practice, and policy in speech, language, and hearing sciences. Though reporting guidelines have been well established for the results of meta-analyses, there is limited focus on the essentials for primary study reporting that allow for inclusion in meta-analyses. To this end, we provide guidance for primary study authors to ensure their studies can maximize their contributions to research syntheses and, specifically, to meta-analyses. We discuss current and ongoing issues related to reporting, provide data-based examples of instances where lack of reporting or transparency has rendered a study ineligible from inclusion in a meta-analysis, encourage editorial teams and peer reviewers to be flexible in the inclusion of supplemental data reporting based on journal requirements and limits, and suggest being explicit and earnest about why these requests are important to advancing the field.

We examine whether emotion recognition deficits extend to facial expressions depicted by emoji. Fifty-one individuals with moderate-severe TBI (25 female) and fifty-one neurotypical peers (26 female) viewed photos of human faces and emoji. Participants selected the best-fitting label from a set of basic emotions (anger, disgust, fear, sadness, neutral, surprise, happy) or social emotions (embarrassed, remorseful, anxious, neutral, flirting, confident, proud). We analyzed the likelihood of correctly labeling an emotion by group (neurotypical, TBI), stimulus condition (basic faces, basic emoji, social emoji), sex (female, male), and their interactions. Participants with TBI did not significantly differ from neurotypical peers in overall emotion labeling accuracy. Both groups had poorer labeling accuracy for emoji compared to faces. Participants with TBI (but not neurotypical peers) had poorer accuracy for labeling social emotions depicted by emoji compared to basic emotions depicted by emoji. There were no effects of participant sex. Because emotion representation is more ambiguous in emoji than human faces, studying emoji use and perception in TBI is an important consideration for understanding functional communication and social participation after brain injury.},

  abstract = {Purpose:  The aim of this study was to establish preliminary reference values for the Visual Analysis of Swallowing Efficiency and Safety (VASES)—a standardized rating methodology used to evaluate swallowing safety and efficiency for flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES). Method:  FEES were completed in nondysphagic, community-dwelling adults using a standardized protocol of 15 swallowing trials that varied by bolus size, consistency, contrast agent, and swallowing instructions. FEES were blindly analyzed using VASES. Primary outcome measures included bolus location at swallow onset, Penetration–Aspiration Scale (PAS) scores, and percentage-based residue ratings for six anatomic landmarks. Secondary outcome measures included sip size, bite size, and number of swallows. Results:  Thirty-nine healthy adults completed the study, yielding an analysis of 584 swallows. Swallows were initiated with the bolus in the pharynx for 41.8\% of trials. PAS 1 was the most common score, accounting for 75.3\% of trials, followed by PAS 3, which accounted for 18.8\% of trials. When residue was present ({$>$} 0\%), the amount was relatively small across all anatomic landmarks, with median residue ratings of 2.0\% (oropharynx), 1.5\% (hypopharynx), 3.0\% (epiglottis), 3.0\% (laryngeal vestibule), and 3.5\% (vocal folds). Five events of aspiration were observed, which were characterized by subglottic residue ratings of 1\%, 3\%, 10\%, 24\%, and 90\%. The average sip size of self-selected volume cup sips of water was 19.8 ml, and the average bite size of a 3.0-g saltine cracker was 1.33 g. Moreover, 78\% of the trials in this study protocol (except 90-ml trials) were completed in a single swallow. Discussion:  The results from this study provide preliminary norms for VASES that could be used as a reference when assessing functional swallowing outcomes during FEES. While this is an important first step in establishing norms for FEES and VASES, clinicians and researchers should be mindful that the normative reference values from this study are from a relatively small study sample (N = 39), with most people below the age of 60 years (n = 30). Future research should expand on these norms by including a greater number of people across the age continuum and with greater racial, ethnic, and gender diversity.

This study aimed to survey the knowledge, implementation, and perceived benefits and barriers of open science practices in CSD. Method:  An online survey was disseminated to researchers in the United States actively engaged in CSD research. Four-core open science practices were examined: preregistration, self-archiving, gold open access, and open data. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and regression models. Results:  Two hundred twenty-two participants met the inclusion criteria. Most participants were doctoral students (38\%) or assistant professors (24\%) at R1 institutions (58\%). Participants reported low knowledge of preregistration and gold open access. There was, however, a high level of desire to learn more for all practices. Implementation of open science practices was also low, most notably for preregistration, gold open access, and open data ({$<$} 25\%). Predictors of knowledge and participation, as well as perceived barriers to implementation, are discussed. Conclusion:  Although participation in open science appears low in the field of CSD, participants expressed a strong desire to learn more in order to engage in these practices in the future.

  abstract = {Recursive binary partitioning is a popular tool for regression analysis. Two fundamental problems of exhaustive search procedures usually applied to fit such models have been known for a long time: overfitting and a selection bias towards covariates with many possible splits or missing values. While pruning procedures are able to solve the overfitting problem, the variable selection bias still seriously affects the interpretability of tree-structured regression models. For some special cases unbiased procedures have been suggested, however lacking a common theoretical foundation. We propose a unified framework for recursive partitioning which embeds tree-structured regression models into a well defined theory of conditional inference procedures. Stopping criteria based on multiple test procedures are implemented and it is shown that the predictive performance of the resulting trees is as good as the performance of established exhaustive search procedures. It turns out that the partitions and therefore the models induced by both approaches are structurally different, confirming the need for an unbiased variable selection. Moreover, it is shown that the prediction accuracy of trees with early stopping is equivalent to the prediction accuracy of pruned trees with unbiased variable selection. The methodology presented here is applicable to all kinds of regression problems, including nominal, ordinal, numeric, censored as well as multivariate response variables and arbitrary measurement scales of the covariates. Data from studies on glaucoma classification, node positive breast cancer survival and mammography experience are re-analyzed.},

The raw source data is usually considered to be confidential. In the case of the U.S. Census Bureau, confidentiality of survey and administrative records microdata is mandated by statute, and this mandate to protect confidentiality is often at odds with the needs of users to extract as much information from the data as possible. Traditional disclosure protection techniques result in official data products that do not fully utilize the information content of the underlying microdata. Typically, these products take the form of simple aggregate tabulations. In a few cases anonymized public-use micro samples are made available, but these face a growing risk of re-identification by the increasing amounts of information about individuals and firms available in the public domain.  One approach for overcoming these risks is to release products based on synthetic data where values are simulated from statistical models designed to mimic the (joint) distributions of the underlying microdata. We discuss recent Census Bureau work to develop and deploy such products. We discuss the benefits and challenges involved with extending the scope of synthetic data products in official statistics.},

  abstract = {Purpose:  The purpose of this project was to examine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on speech-language pathologist (SLP) service provision for emergent bilinguals who use augmentative and alternative communication (AAC). One prominent issue in AAC service delivery is the efficacy and feasibility of providing AAC services via telepractice. The COVID-19 pandemic intensified this issue as most providers, clients, and families adjusted to remote service delivery models. While emerging evidence supports telepractice in AAC, little is known about the potential benefits and challenges of telepractice for emergent bilinguals who use AAC and their families. Method:  Data were collected via a nationwide survey. Licensed SLPs (N = 160) completed an online questionnaire with Likert-type, multiple-choice, and open-ended questions, analyzed using mixed methods. Results:  Findings illustrated a shift in service delivery from in-person to telepractice and hybrid (both telepractice and in-person) models. Overall, child intervention outcomes declined for emergent bilinguals who used AAC during the COVID-19 pandemic, regardless of service delivery format. However, collaboration increased for many providers and families. Qualitative analyses highlighted barriers to AAC service provision for emergent bilinguals who use AAC that were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as factors that facilitated collaboration and family engagement. Conclusion:  These findings suggest that, despite challenges, telepractice or hybrid services may be a promising approach to provide more culturally responsive, family-centered care for emergent bilinguals who use AAC.

  abstract = {Background Although increased nasality can originate from basal ganglia dysfunction, data regarding hypernasality in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Huntington’s disease (HD) are very sparse. The aim of the current study was to analyze acoustic and perceptual correlates of velopharyngeal seal closure in 37 PD and 37 HD participants in comparison to 37 healthy control speakers. Methods Acoustical analysis was based on sustained phonation of the vowel /i/ and perceptual analysis was based on monologue. Perceptual analysis was performed by 10 raters using The Great Ormond Street Speech Assessment ’98. Acoustic parameters related to changes in a 1/3-octave band centered on 1 kHz were proposed to reflect nasality level and behavior through utterance. Results Perceptual analysis showed the occurrence of mild to moderate hypernasality in 65\% of PD, 89\% of HD and 22\% of control speakers. Based on acoustic analyses, 27\% of PD, 54\% of HD and 19\% of control speakers showed an increased occurrence of hypernasality. In addition, 78\% of HD patients demonstrated a high occurrence of intermittent hypernasality. Further results indicated relationships between the acoustic parameter representing fluctuation of nasality and perceptual assessment (r = 0.51, p {$<$} 0.001) as well as the Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale chorea composite subscore (r = 0.42, p = 0.01). Conclusions In conclusion the acoustic assessment showed that abnormal nasality was not a common feature of PD, whereas patients with HD manifested intermittent hypernasality associated with chorea.},

Method: Thirty-five assistant professors (16 from very high research activity (R1) institutions, 19 from institutions with other Carnegie classifications) participated in one 1-hour virtual focus group conducted via Zoom recording technology. The researchers used a conventional content analysis approach to analyze the focus group data and develop categories from the discussions. Results: Five categories were developed from the focus groups: (a) a desire to learn about OS through opportunities for independent learning and learning with peers, (b) perceived benefits of engaging in OS on assistant professors’ careers, the broader scientific community, and the quality of research in the field of CSD; (c) personal factors that act as barriers and/or facilitators to engaging in OS practices; (d) systemic factors that act as barriers and/or facilitators to engaging in OS practices; and (e) differences in perceptions of R1 and non-R1 assistant professors. Conclusions: Assistant professors in CSD perceive benefits of OS for their careers, the scientific community, and the field. However, they face many barriers (e.g., time, lack of knowledge and training) which impede their engagement in OS practices. Recommendations for CSD assistant professors, academic institutions, publishers, and funding agencies are provided to reduce barriers to engagement in OS practices.},

However, disclosure risks can sometimes limit the sharing of open data, especially in datasets that include sensitive details or information from individuals with rare disorders. This article introduces the concept of synthetic datasets, which is an emerging method originally developed to permit the sharing of confidential census data. Synthetic datasets mimic real datasets by preserving their statistical properties and the relationships between variables. Importantly, this method also reduces disclosure risk to essentially nil as no record in the synthetic dataset represents a real individual. This practical guide with accompanying R script enables biobehavioural researchers to create synthetic datasets and assess their utility via the synthpop R package. By sharing synthetic datasets that mimic original datasets that could not otherwise be made open, researchers can ensure the reproducibility of their results and facilitate data exploration while maintaining participant privacy.},

Anonymizing datasets through de-identification and sampling before sharing them has been the main tool used to address those concerns. We here propose a generative copula-based method that can accurately estimate the likelihood of a specific person to be correctly re-identified, even in a heavily incomplete dataset. On 210 populations, our method obtains AUC scores for predicting individual uniqueness ranging from 0.84 to 0.97, with low false-discovery rate. Using our model, we find that 99.98\% of Americans would be correctly re-identified in any dataset using 15 demographic attributes. Our results suggest that even heavily sampled anonymized datasets are unlikely to satisfy the modern standards for anonymization set forth by GDPR and seriously challenge the technical and legal adequacy of the de-identification release-and-forget model.},

We evaluated data availability in research articles across nine disciplines in Nature and Science magazines and recorded corresponding authors’ concerns, requests and reasons for declining data sharing. Although data sharing has improved in the last decade and particularly in recent years, data availability and willingness to share data still differ greatly among disciplines. We observed that statements of data availability upon (reasonable) request are inefficient and should not be allowed by journals. To improve data sharing at the time of manuscript acceptance, researchers should be better motivated to release their data with real benefits such as recognition, or bonus points in grant and job applications. We recommend that data management costs should be covered by funding agencies; publicly available research data ought to be included in the evaluation of applications; and surveillance of data sharing should be enforced by both academic publishers and funders.

Additionally, this study examined if the strength of the relationship between acoustic vowel measures and intelligibility differed based on how intelligibility was measured (i.e., orthographic transcriptions [OTs] and visual analog scale [VAS] ratings). Method:  The Grandfather Passage was read aloud by 40 speakers with dysarthria of varying etiologies, including Parkinson's disease (n = 10), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (n = 10), Huntington's disease (n = 10), and cerebellar ataxia (n = 10). Token- and trajectory-based acoustic vowel measures were calculated from the passage. Naïve listeners (N = 140) were recruited via crowdsourcing to provide OTs and VAS intelligibility ratings. Hierarchical linear regression models were created to model OTs and VAS intelligibility ratings using the acoustic vowel measures as predictors. Results:  Traditional VSA was the sole significant predictor of speech intelligibility for both the OTs (R2 = .259) and VAS (R2 = .236) models. In contrast, the trajectory-based measures were not significant predictors of intelligibility. Additionally, the OTs and VAS intelligibility ratings conveyed similar information. Conclusions:  The findings suggest that traditional token-based vowel measures better predict intelligibility than trajectory-based measures. Additionally, the findings suggest that VAS methods are comparable to OT methods for estimating speech intelligibility for research purposes.},

  abstract = {Introduction In January, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) implemented a Data Management and Sharing Policy aiming to leverage data collected during NIH-funded research. The COVID-19 pandemic illustrated that this practice is equally vital for augmenting patient research. In addition, data sharing acts as a necessary safeguard against the introduction of analytical biases. While the pandemic provided an opportunity to curtail critical research issues such as reproducibility and validity through data sharing, this did not materialise in practice and became an example of ‘Open Data in Appearance Only’ (ODIAO). Here, we define ODIAO as the intent of data sharing without the occurrence of actual data sharing (eg, material or digital data transfers).,  Objective Propose a framework that states the main risks associated with data sharing, systematically present risk mitigation strategies and provide examples through a healthcare lens.,  Methods This framework was informed by critical aspects of both the Open Data Institute and the NIH’s 2023 Data Management and Sharing Policy plan guidelines.,  Results Through our examination of legal, technical, reputational and commercial categories, we find barriers to data sharing ranging from misinterpretation of General Data Privacy Rule to lack of technical personnel able to execute large data transfers. From this, we deduce that at numerous touchpoints, data sharing is presently too disincentivised to become the norm.,  Conclusion In order to move towards Open Data, we propose the creation of mechanisms for incentivisation, beginning with recentring data sharing on patient benefits, additional clauses in grant requirements and committees to encourage adherence to data reporting practices.},
